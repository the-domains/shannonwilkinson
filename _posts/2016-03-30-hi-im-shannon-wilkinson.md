Hi, I'm Shannon Wilkinson, a life coach, change artist and summit seeker. As a coach, I use mind-bending tools like Neuro-Linguistic Programming and Hypnosis to help you change your mind, change your behaviors, and ultimately, change the world. My personal credo? Less angst. More action. Less crisis. More change. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/129dee1c-6236-4b78-ab05-5604fb7c5341.jpg)
