Hi, I'm Shannon Wilkinson, a life coach, change artist and summit seeker. 

As a coach, I use mind-bending tools like Neuro-Linguistic Programming and Hypnosis to help you change your mind, change your behaviors, and ultimately, change the world. 

My personal credo? Less angst. More action. Less crisis. More change.
